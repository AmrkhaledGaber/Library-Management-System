Library Management System
1. Book Class:
• Create a Book class to represent each book in the library.
• Include attributes such as bookId, title, author, genre, and availabilityStatus.
• This class will be used to instantiate objects for each book in the library.
2. Member Class:
• Develop a Member class to represent library members.
• Include attributes such as memberId, name, contactInfo, and booksBorrowed.
• Implement methods for members to borrow and return books.
3. Catalog Class:
• Create a Catalog class to manage the library's book inventory using data
structures like linked lists.
• Implement methods to add new books, update book details, and search for
books.
• Utilize a linked list to efficiently organize and maintain the book catalog.
4. Loan Class:
• Implement a Loan class to represent book loans.
• Include attributes such as loanId, bookId, memberId, issueDate, and
returnDate.
• Methods should handle the process of borrowing and returning books, updating
availability status.
5. PendingRequestsQueue Class:
• Create a PendingRequestsQueue class using a queue data structure to
manage pending book requests.
• Define methods to enqueue new requests when a book is not available and
dequeue when the book becomes available.
• This queue ensures fair handling of pending book requests.
6. Librarian Interface:
• Develop a user interface for the librarian to interact with the system.
• Allow the librarian to add new books, update book details, and view the status of
book loans.
• Display notifications for pending book requests and manage book returns
efficiently.
7. Member Interface:
• Create a separate interface for library members to browse the catalog and
borrow/return books.
• Display available books, borrowed books, and provide a streamlined process for
book transactions.
8. Search Algorithm:
• Implement a searching algorithm (e.g., linear search or binary search) to quickly
locate specific books in the catalog.
• Enhances the librarian's ability to find and manage books efficiently.
9. Sorting in Library Management System:
1.Sort Books by Title:
• Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quicksort) to sort books
alphabetically by title in the catalog.
• This helps users easily locate books in the catalog.
2.Sort Members by Name:
• Apply sorting to arrange members alphabetically by name.
• Provides an organized list for librarians to manage and search for
members efficiently.
3.Sort Loans by Due Date:
• Sort the list of book loans by due date, with the soonest due date first.
• Assists librarians in managing overdue books more effectively.
10. Due Date Management:
• Implement a due date system for borrowed books, sending reminders to
members before the due date.
• Automatically update the availability status of returned books and handle overdue
books.
11. Reporting System:
• Include a feature for the librarian to generate reports, such as books currently on
loan, overdue books, and popular genres.
• Provides insights into library usage and helps in decision-making.
12. Exception Handling:
• Implement robust exception handling to manage scenarios like attempting to
borrow an unavailable book or invalid member details.
• Ensure the system gracefully handles unexpected situations.
